Welcome to my Flask / SQLalchemy app which is a simple to-do list.

Click [here](https://rp-django-todo-app.herokuapp.com/) to view deployed app.

This app allows Users to create new tasks, edit existing tasks and delete or strike-through completed tasks using either the toggle button option of by clicking on edit and selecting done.

It was really good fun to create this simple app and I learned so much from this task.
